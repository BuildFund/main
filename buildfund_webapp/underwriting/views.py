"""API views for underwriting.

This module defines two endpoints:

* A read‑only viewset for retrieving existing underwriting reports.  Only
  authenticated users can access their reports.  Admins can list all
  reports.
* A POST endpoint for generating a new underwriting report.  It takes
  a `project_id` and a `report_type` (borrower or lender), builds a
  prompt from the project and related data, and calls the OpenAI
  ChatGPT API to generate the report text.  The result is saved as
  an `UnderwritingReport` instance.

The OpenAI API key is read from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` setting.  If
this environment variable is missing, the endpoint returns a 500
error with a clear message rather than attempting an unauthenticated
call.  All exceptions from the OpenAI client are caught and
translated into API errors.
