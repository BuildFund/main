"""
Mapping app for geocoding and address autocomplete.

This app exposes simple API endpoints for performing geocoding,
reverse geocoding and address autocomplete against the Google
Maps Platform.  All calls are made from the back‑end using the
server‑side API key defined in the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` setting.  The
key should never be exposed on the client.
