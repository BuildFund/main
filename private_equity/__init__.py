"""Private equity (PE) module for BuildFund.

This app defines models, serializers and views to support private
capital fundraising.  Borrowers can list private equity opportunities,
lenders can invest in them, and administrators can approve or
decline submissions.  The models are designed to run on MongoDB via
Djongo without migration complications.
